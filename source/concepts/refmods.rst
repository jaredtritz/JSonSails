Refmods
=======

Refmods, or Reference Modules, are modules which have been included into other
modules.  This means that the the included module will be rendered as a
component, at it's designated position, within the including module.

Rendering
"""""""""

Refmods are rendered in an iframe the same way that modules are rendered.  Configuration 
is exposed so that each Refmod can be configured independently.  

To non-technical developers
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Even non-technical developers can learn to compose novel content using Refmods.
This is especially true if the technical developer have designed Refmods which
intentionally work together by composition.  In that case, both selection and
configuration will allow even non-technical developers to be creative.

UFiles and SFiles associated to a module can also be re-mapped when a Refmod is
used to render the module.  This allows developers the option of barrowing a module
but managing their own data for their own users.
