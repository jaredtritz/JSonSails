Refmods
=======

Refmods, or Reference Modules, are modules which have been included into other
modules. This means that the Refmod will be rendered as a part of the including
module, at it's designated position.

Rendering
"""""""""

Refmods are rendered in an iframe the same way that modules are rendered.  Configuration 
is exposed so that each Refmod can be configured independently.  

To non-technical developers
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To non-technical developers Refmods are new instances of a configurable or
customizable module.  Non-technical developers can also learn to compose novel
content using Refmods in combination.  This is especially true if the technical
developer have designed Refmods which intentionally work together by
composition.  In that case, both selection and configuration will allow
non-technical developers to be creative.

UFiles and SFiles associated to a module can also be re-mapped when a Refmod is
used to render the module.  This allows developers the option of borrowing a module
but managing their own data for their own users.
