Data Management
===============

Data may imported or exported from UFiles by the UFile owner.  This allows the
owner of the data to populate the user's values from an external source,
especially useful if you have removed the option for users to write their own
values.  An owner may also want to download the collection of UFile values to
perform an offline analysis.
