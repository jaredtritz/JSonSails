Palette
=======

The palette located in the bottom pane of the IDE and is shared among all
modules in the IDE. The first 3 items on the palette are the built-in node
types, and the remaining items are modules added by the user. Palette items can
be added to the current module's node tree with drag/drop. 

.. important:: Drag/drop from palette has unsolved bug and often requires a browser reload to begin working

For more information on the 4 types of nodes found on the palette:

* :ref:`refnode-closed`
* :ref:`leaf-node`
* :ref:`vertical-node`
* :ref:`horizontal-node`
