Node Tree
==========

The node tree is located in the left pain of the IDE.  

Important points:

* node independence/isolation
  the code in a node cannot interfere with the code in another node
  unless you do so intentionally, or utilize window

* rendering order of nodes (breadth first)
  html first
  js second
  css applied by browser

* parent/child properties

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1
    :glob:

    node_properties
    root_node
    refnode
    leaf_node
    vertical_node
    horizontal_node
