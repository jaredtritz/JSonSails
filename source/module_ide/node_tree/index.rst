Node Tree
==========

The node tree is located in the left pane of the IDE and each node is part of
the module. Together, when the nodes tree is rendered it produces the module.
Each node is rendered in isolation so that its code doesn't interfere with
other nodes.  For inter-node communication you may choose to use "window" which
is a shared namespace. 

.. important:: Refnodes are rendered in an iframe and so do not share the window namespace
