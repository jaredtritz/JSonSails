Saving
======

There is no history and no backups, so saving is always saving over the 
previous version of the module code and configuration.  Therefore, you
should take care to avoid loss of data by keeping your own copy in version
control.

Save
^^^^

The "save" link will send a copy of the entire module to the server to
overwrite the previous version.  

Save as
^^^^^^^

The "save as" link will send a request to the server to create a replica, or
clone, of the current module.  The clone will utilize the ref-behavior settings
of the included objects to decide whether to link to existing objects or create
new ones.
