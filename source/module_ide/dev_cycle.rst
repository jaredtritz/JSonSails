Development Cycle
=================

Module development is an iterative process of editing and previewing. 

Editing
^^^^^^^

When a module is edited its code and configuration are modified.  In edit mode,
clicking on a node in the tree will open the editor for that node, where the
code and configuration of that node are exposed.


Previewing
^^^^^^^^^^

When the module is previewed it is rendered to see what it looks like and test
how it behaves.  Clicking on a node in the tree will highlight all of the
contents rendered under that node.
