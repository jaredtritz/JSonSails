Edit/Preview
============

.. note::

  The URL of the development interface (IDE) for a module is: jsonsails.com/module/#/edit

Module development is an iterative process of editing and previewing, and
toggling between these modes is achieved with a radio button in the IDE top
panel. 

Editing
^^^^^^^

When editing a module its code and/or configuration are modified.  In edit mode,
clicking on a node in the tree will open the editor for that node, where the
code and configuration of that node are exposed.


Previewing
^^^^^^^^^^

When the module is previewed it is rendered to see what it looks like and test
how it behaves.  Clicking on a node in the tree will highlight all of the
contents rendered under that node.
