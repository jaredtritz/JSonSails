*What are the key features of JSonSails and how it works?*

We want to expose code all the way to lowest level so that developers can
always evaluate the quality, re-usability, and adaptability of a resource.
However, we want resources, such as code and user data to be easy to leverage,
share, evolve, and maintain. Thus, we've designed our IDE to support
configuation and composition of resources as well, giving equal or even higher
priority to that as building new resources.

JSonSails offers a minimalist but complete "in browser" development
environment. The IDE doesn't require any special configuration or setup, and is
meant to eliminate the need for setting up personal development environments.
The IDE supports coding, editing, review, and maintenance tasks, for example.
Even initial development for simple projects can be carried out in our IDE. We
take inspiration from other online web coding environments like JSFiddle_, and
integrates a code editor into the environment which is designed to support
various non-coding tasks as well, like barrowing and configuring resources.

Only the owner can edit a resource, though the owner can pass ownership of the
resource to anyone they choose. 

Permission must be granted by the owner a resource when someone requests use of
that resource by their own application.
