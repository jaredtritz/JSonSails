*What is JSonSails for and should I consider using it?*

JSonSails makes creating and maintaining *personalized* web content easier.  An
example of personalized web content is an online treatment plan, which guides
patients through a tailored medical treatment.  In this case content is
determined by personal information about the patient. This information might be
collected within the system, or loaded into the system from an external source.

Another example is strategic content delivery to satisfy the needs of a
collaborative online task such as having students review one anothers homework
assignment.

JSonSails also facilitates collaborative development of resources through
sharing of reusable modules and user data.  Managers, instructors,
development teams, or even the JSonSails support staff, can all work
together in creating web modules and content which are easy to configure and
maintain.  This helps create end products which are more valuable to users.

Lastly, in a unique way, we've removed the need for server configuration in
creating web content.  Thus we expect that even non-tailored content, which
does not leverage user data, will be easier to develop, deploy, and
maintain in this environment. For example, we envision the use JSonSails for delivering general content similiar to WordPress_.
