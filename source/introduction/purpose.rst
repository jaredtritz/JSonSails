*What is JSonSails for and should I consider using it?*

Content personalization
"""""""""""""""""""""""

JSonSails offers a unique way of managing code and user data which makes
creating and maintaining **personalized web content** easier.  An example of
personalized web content is an online treatment plan, which guides patients
through a tailored medical treatment.  In this case content is determined by
personal information about the patient. This information might be collected
within the system, or loaded into the system from an external source.
JSonSails greatly reduces the overhead associated collection and management of
personal data, and it also makes it easier to integrate data into the content
or display logic.

Another example of personalization is strategic content delivery, for example
to satisfy the needs of a collaborative online task such as having students
reviewing one anothers homework assignments.  In this case, the design strategy 
might simple be to ensure everyone who submits an assignment reviews an
assignment which is not their own.

Collaborative development
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

JSonSails also facilitates **collaborative development of content** through
sharing of reusable resources, including code and user data.  Managers,
instructors, development teams, or even the JSonSails support staff, can all
work together in creating resources and content which are easy to configure and
maintain.  This helps create end products which are more valuable to the end
users.

Lastly, in a unique way, we've removed the need for server configuration in
creating web content.  Thus we expect that even non-tailored content, which
does not leverage user data, will be easier to develop, deploy, and maintain in
this environment. For example, we also envision the use JSonSails for
delivering general content similiar to WordPress_.
