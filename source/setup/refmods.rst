Refmods
=======

Refmod setup involves linking the refmod to

* ufiles
* sfiles

UFiles and SFiles can be re-mapped for refmods, to allow users to maintain
ownership of data, or simply to keep data separate for different deployments of
a module.

The reference behavior of included ufiles and sfiles can also be set, having
the same effect as setting the reference behavior for modules themselves.
