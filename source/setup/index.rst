Setup Pages
===========

Each of the main objects in the system can be edited on its corresponding setup
page, with the objects intance ID appearing in the URL.  

On the setup page you edit the object properties, and also the links to any
included objects.  The alias which is used for the inclusion will be used to
reference the object in the corresponding scripting environment.

It is also where you can pass the ownership of the object.

.. note:: 
  
  Don't forget to save your changes!  After editing an object, use ctrl-s to
  save the changes.
